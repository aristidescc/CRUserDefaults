/**
 * CRUserDefaults is helper class that offers a interface to write data on
 * [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]. The distinctive value CRUserDefaults has,
 * is allows that standardUserDefaults acts as an object, so you only have to add
 * properties to it, then declare this property as @dynamic and automatically you 
 * have a new property in standardUserDefaults.
 *
 * Also you can declare a property of any object type and it will be store too, but 
 * you should implement NSCoding protocol for custom objects.
 *
 * The only concern is all property have to be Object pointers, so if you are going
 * to declare boolean property you must declare it as NSNumber.
